# OctoGWT
## Given-When-Then test framework on steroids
*Powered by Selenium WebDriver technology*

For GWT there are many test frameworks to pick from. One of these is [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) (implemented in the C# world as [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org/)), which is good for what it's for (increasing readability of tests for standard human beings). However, developing tests in this system can take quite some time.

If you think the following sample test excites you, please on below.

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void TestGoogleSearch()
{
    using (var context = new MyTestContext())
    {

        //start a GWT test by specifying it with predicates.
        context
            .Given(g =>
            {
                g.IAmOnPage("https://www.google.com");
                g.ICanSeeAnElement(By.XPath("//input[@name='q']"));
            })
            .When(w =>
            {
                w.ITypeInAnElement(By.XPath("//input[@name='q']"), "The \"GWT\" framework is cool!");
                w.IClickOnAnElement(By.XPath("//button[@type='submit']"));

                //wait for the search result list to appear.
                w.IWaitForAnElementToAppear(By.CssSelector(".srg"));
                w.IWait(5000);
            })
            .Then(t =>
            {
                //now we should see multiple result items.
                t.IShouldSeeMultipleElementsContainingText(By.CssSelector(".g"), "GWT");
            });

        //start yet another GWT test, this time by specifying it with custom instructions.
        context
            .Given(new GivenIAmOnGooglesFrontPage())
            .When(new WhenISearchOnGoogleFor("I can also use \"instructions\"!"))
            .Then(new ThenIShouldSeeAGoogleResultContaining("instructions"));

    }
}
```

The above example contains two GWTs that will run in parallel, basically doing almost the same thing. The first one is defined via *context predicates*, while the latter is defined using *instruction classes*.

Each of them see if they can search for something on Google. They start by going to the front page (the **Given** clause), from where they type in some text in the search field (the **When** clause), and then finally assert (check) if a result is present in the result list (the **Then** clause).

#### Re-using steps - instruction classes
In the above example, in the second GWT that is added, instruction classes are used to re-use steps or chunks of tests. The Â´GivenIAmOnGooglesFrontPage`, `WhenISearchOnGoogleFor` and `ThenIShouldSeeAGoogleResultContaining` classes simply just implement the `IInstruction` interface, overriding a single method.

You can see all of the classes below.

```csharp
sealed class GivenIAmOnGooglesFrontPage : IGivenInstruction
{
    public void Run(GivenWebDriverFacade g)
    {
        g.IAmOnPage("https://www.google.com");
        g.ICanSeeAnElement(By.XPath("//input[@name='q']"));
    }
}
```

### Parallelism simplified for remarkable performance
Running tests (especially WebDriver driven integration tests) can take a while. And if you apply Continuous Integration in your workflow, this typically means that these tests must run on a build server every time you want to get something out.

Wouldn't it be great if you could somehow **run several GWTs at once**, on **several browsers at the same time**? With OctoGWT, all GWTs are run in several browsers (that you specify) at the same time. Furthermore, each GWT that is created within the same context is run in parallel.

That's insanely effective if you think about it. Let's say you've created a setup with three test browsers. One for Chrome, one for Firefox, and one for Internet Explorer. Running the test from the code sample above (consisting of two GWTs defined in the same context) would then run in parallel, with each GWT **also** running on all three browsers. That's 6 browser instances running **at the same time** evaluating **two GWTs at once**.

### Get rid of garbage
It's frustrating when your build server runs out of memory because after a few thousand test runs, or even more frustrating when your PC is left with a lot of open webbrowsers after testing, because the test didn't clean up properly.

OctoGWT takes care of all that. When a context is disposed (after leaving the ``using`` scope), it also closes the browser windows and all associated resources with it.

### No plugins needed
You don't need any plugins for Visual Studio to get OctoGWT working. It'll work directly with what you've already got.

## Contribute
The OctoGWT framework is still new and young, but I am hoping others will help turn it into something capable of simplifying browser testing as a whole. Feel free to make pull requests!
